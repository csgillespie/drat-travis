# Combining Drat and Travis

 * [Drat](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat) is a useful little package, for, *inter-alia*, using
github *gh-pages* to as an R repository. 
 * [Travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis) is a hosted continuous integration service. 
 It is integrated with GitHub and offers first class support for a number of languages, but importantly, R.
